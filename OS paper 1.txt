1)Write the shell scrpit that redirecs all the even umbers to a file called "even" and odd numbers to a file called "odd" from a list of n numbers given as input through file.
-->
len=5
arr=()
echo "Enter Numbers: "
for((i=0;i<len;i++));
do
        read arr[$i]
done
i=0
j=0
even=()
odd=()
for num in ${arr[@]};
do
        if [ $((num % 2)) -eq 0 ];
        then
                even[$i]=$num
                ((i++))
        else
                odd[$j]=$num
                ((j++))
        fi
done
touch even.txt
echo "${even[@]}" >> "even.txt"
touch odd.txt
echo "${odd[@]}" >> "odd.txt"
echo "Successfully created file and Saved the content in even.txt and odd.txt"


2)Write a sheel script to display the smallest file name( in respecr of the string length) among the list of fikes avavilabl in the curret directory
-->12.sh
files=$(ls)

smallest_file=""
smallest_length=99999


for file in $files;
do
  length=${#file}


  if [ $length -lt $smallest_length ]; then
      smallest_file=$file
      smallest_length=$length
  fi
done

echo "Smallest file name is $smallest_file"

3)Write a shell program to sort an array of numbers using any sort method
